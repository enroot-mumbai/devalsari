            Conserving fresh water systems in the Aglar Valley
            The Society actively works towards conservation of freshwater systems in the landscape. 
            The threats are many: use of bleaching powder and electricity to kill fish, pollution of the water, and killing of other fresh water biodiversity such as amphibians along with the fish.
