            <h4>Livelyhoods</h4>
                <p>To promote local livelihoods, in addition to ecotourism, the Society is focused on bee-keeping and its future plans include homestays and promotion of organic produce.</p>

            <h4>Bee-keeping</h4>
            <p>
                The society hopes to revive bee-keeping as an alternate livelihood in Uttarakhand through honey production, promote bee conservation and improve productivity of crops, horticulture and forest produce.
            </p>

            <p>
            *Apis cerana indica* is the native bee of the hills of Uttarakhand. 
            Traditionally, this was the bee used in wall beehives to produce honey. 
            However, in recent years, people’s enthusiasm for bee-keeping and honey production is decreasing. 
            There is need to rejuvenate bee keeping in Uttarakhand both as an alternate livelihood and for increased crop production.
            </p>
